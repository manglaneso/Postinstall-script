Ubuntu Post Install Script
==========================
Shell script to automatically install stuff I like and configure things around in Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 fresh installs.

It is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.

This script uses files from [elementary cursor theme](https://github.com/snwh/elementary-cursors) which are also distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt). 

It also uses a python script by Jacob Vlijm which can be found [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/468811/remove-vlc-player-from-sound-menu-in-unity-bar/471577).

You can get the code from the git repository:
	git clone https://github.com/manglasape/Postinstall-script.git

##Usage:

Give the script executable privileges:
	chmod a+x postinstall.sh

Then run it!:
	./postinstall.sh
